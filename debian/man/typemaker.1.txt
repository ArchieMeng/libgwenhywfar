NAME
----
typemaker - source and header file generator for Gwenhywfar and AqBanking data structures

SYNOPSIS
--------
'typemaker' [options] <input file(s)>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool generates source and header files for simple data containers
from XML files.  It creates fromDb and toDb functions for structs and
getters and setters for any member.

This makes it easier to maintain data containers with many members (as
in AB_TRANSACTION).

A member you add to the XML file will immediately be loaded, saved,
destroyed and copied with the rest of the struct upon request
(e.g. _fromDb() will load all members from a GWEN_DB).

The current version creates a C file and headers for it.

It also creates appropriate API documentation if provided with the
source XML file.
